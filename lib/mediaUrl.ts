/**
 * Client-safe helper for building the app's own IPFS media proxy path.
 *
 * Components should use this instead of pointing directly at
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY` so media requests flow through `/api/media/[cid]`
 * (see app/api/media/[cid]/route.ts). That gives repeat viewers a CDN-cached
 * response from this app's own edge instead of round-tripping to Pinata every
 * time, and keeps the raw gateway URL out of page HTML so it can't be
 * trivially hotlinked from other sites.
 *
 * This file must stay free of Node-only imports (no `crypto`, no server
 * secrets) since it's imported from client components. Signed-URL generation
 * lives in lib/mediaUrlSigning.ts, which is server-only.
